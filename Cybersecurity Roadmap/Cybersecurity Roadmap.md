### Cybersecurity Roadmap 🚀:

#### 1. **Foundational Programming and Networking Concepts** 💻🌐:
   - Start with learning basic programming alongside fundamental networking concepts. Understanding how networks operate (protocols, OSI model, TCP/IP) is essential for cybersecurity professionals.
   - Resources: [Cisco's Networking Basics](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/small-business/resource-center/networking/networking-basics.html) offers a good starting point.

#### 2. **Learn about Vulnerabilities, Including Network Vulnerabilities** 🛠️🔍:
   - Dive into common network vulnerabilities alongside web vulnerabilities at OWASP. Learn about attacks such as Man-in-the-Middle (MitM), Denial of Service (DoS), and packet sniffing.
   - Resource: [OWASP](https://owasp.org/) and [Cybrary's Network Security Courses](https://www.cybrary.it/catalog/cybersecurity/network-security/).

#### 3. **Hands-On Labs with Portswigger and Network Simulation Tools** 🎓🔌:
   - Use Portswigger for web application vulnerabilities and supplement this with network-focused labs using tools like GNS3 or Packet Tracer for creating and testing network configurations.
   - Resources: [GNS3](https://www.gns3.com/) and [Cisco Packet Tracer](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer).

#### 4. **Apply Knowledge to Real Projects and Network Setups** 🚀🖧:
   - Practice securing networks you have access to, understanding firewall configurations, setting up VPNs, and implementing secure network protocols.

#### 5. **Mitigate Vulnerabilities with a Focus on Network Security** 🛡️🔐:
   - Study network segmentation, intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), and secure network architecture designs.
   - Resource: [SANS Reading Room - Network Security Papers](https://www.sans.org/reading-room/).

#### 6. **Explore Mobile and Network Application Vulnerabilities** 📱🖧:
   - Beyond DVWA for web and mobile vulnerabilities, use tools like Wireshark for network traffic analysis and understanding network-based attacks.
   - Resource: [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/).

#### 7. **Delve into Advanced Networks and Servers with TryHackMe and Beyond** 🔐💡:
   - TryHackMe provides specific paths and rooms for network security and penetration testing that cover both basic and advanced network concepts.
   - Additionally, explore platforms like Offensive Security Proving Grounds and Hack The Box for more network-focused challenges.

### Enhanced Note with a Network Twist 📝🌍:
- **Understand the Importance of Network Protocols:** Learning about protocols such as HTTP/HTTPS, FTP, SSH, and DNS is crucial for understanding how data moves across the internet and how it can be secured.
- **Practical Network Security Experience:** Setting up your home lab with virtual machines (VMs) and practicing configuring secure networks will give you hands-on experience that is invaluable.
- **Network Certifications:** Consider certifications like CompTIA Network+, Cisco's CCNA, or the Certified Network Defender (CND) for a more formal education in network security.

### Additional Networking Tips 💼🔧:
- **Simulate Real-World Networks:** Use network simulation tools to practice your skills in a risk-free environment.
- **Stay Informed on Network Security Trends:** Follow network security forums, blogs, and news sites. Understanding the current landscape of network security will help you stay ahead.
- **Networking Community Engagement:** Join communities such as the Cisco Networking Academy, Reddit’s r/networking, or specific cybersecurity Discord channels to exchange knowledge and experiences.

Incorporating a strong understanding of networks and their security into your cybersecurity roadmap enriches your skill set, making you not just a cybersecurity professional but a well-rounded expert in protecting digital and network assets. 🌐🛡️
